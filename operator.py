# 3rd day  and I am using github totay we are studying about operator 
#operator are symbol where are use to perform operand

print('Addition: ', 1 + 2)        # 3
print('Subtraction: ', 2 - 1)     # 1
print('Multiplication: ', 2 * 3)  # 6
print ('Division: ', 4 / 2)       # 2.0  Division in Python gives floating number
print('Division: ', 6 / 2)        # 3.0         
print('Division: ', 7 / 2)        # 3.5
print('Division without the remainder: ', 7 // 2)   # 3,  gives without the floating number or without the remaining
print ('Division without the remainder: ',7 // 3)   # 2
print('Modulus: ', 3 % 2)         # 1, Gives the remainder
print('Exponentiation: ', 2 ** 3) # 9 it means 2 * 2 * 2
